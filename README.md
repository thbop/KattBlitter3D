## Build Instructions

This project uses [SDL 2.32.2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.32.2) though any version of SDL2 should work fine.

1. Place `SDL2.dll` in your build directory (`/`)
2. Put SDL2 headers (include stuff) in `include/external/SDL2`
3. Put the `libSDL2.dll.a` in the `lib/` directory
4. Run `make`
